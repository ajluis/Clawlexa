# Clawdbot Gateway Configuration for Clawlexa (Raspberry Pi)
#
# This runs Clawdbot directly on the Pi as the brain for Clawlexa.
# The LLM API calls still go to cloud (Anthropic), but the gateway itself is local.
#
# To start: clawdbot gateway start
# Or via systemd: sudo systemctl start clawdbot-gateway

gateway:
  port: 3000
  host: 127.0.0.1

model:
  provider: anthropic
  model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  # Good balance of speed and quality for voice interactions.
  # Upgrade to claude-opus-4-0-20250514 for more complex reasoning (slower, more expensive).

# Set your API key in .env or export it:
#   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
#
# You can also set it here (not recommended — use env vars):
# anthropic_api_key: sk-ant-...

auth:
  # Gateway token — must match CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN in Clawlexa's .env
  # Generated automatically by setup.sh, or set your own:
  token: "${CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN}"
